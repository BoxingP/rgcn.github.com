# Howto 教程


## 主办您的第一场 Rails Girls 活动

我们的目标是赋予女性学习技术的工具。Rails Girls 活动对于每一位互联网开发的初学者都将是一次很好的体验。

Rails Girls 于2010年底成立于赫尔辛基。我们最初只计划开展一次活动，然而没有想到在世界各地会涌现这么多的分部！这个教程就是为了帮助您开展自己的活动而设计的。

如果您准备开展本地分部的活动请用此电邮[contact@railsgirls.com](mailto:contact@railsgirls.com)联系我们。未来的活动路线图可以在这里访问 [www.railsgirls.com](http://railsgirls.com).


### 基础知识
Rails Girls 活动是非盈利性的。我们不收取任何费用，也不会向向教练或演讲者支付报酬。参与活动不需要编程经验，也没有年龄限制。只要有一台笔记本和好奇心就可以参加活动！
  
一次为期两天的活动将包含很多团队合作与简短精炼的演讲，重点是编程、设计和web。这里将不会有正式的演说台或辩论会，气氛最好是随和与务实的。越少抽象概念，越多参与精神越好！

#### Rails Girls 理念

* 让你自己的个性焕发光彩，时刻不忘统观全局。在解释、重复一个知识点的时候要把它放到大环境中去，而不是游离其外，从而使听众失去兴趣或不知所云
* 互联网是由人创建的，它不会因为您的把玩而崩溃。我们要不断地提醒听众网站的人性一面：鼓励教练们讨论开源社区、自己的程序员偶像和激励自己的故事。
* 复制粘贴是王道。编程本身并不是整个工作的核心，好比我们不可能在一天之内学会汉语，我们也无法在一天之内学会所有编程中用到的语法和表达式。活动的宗旨就是向学员授之以渔。
* 这个小世界是围着女孩们旋转的！但是大龄女青年、家庭主妇甚至男生们都是可以参加的。Rails Girls里的"Girls"不仅限于字面上的“女孩”，而是指一种年轻上进的心理状态。两名发起人都是听着辣妹(Spice Girls)的歌长大的，他们从不觉得“女孩”这个词只是指可爱的小女生，或隐含着任何负面的意义。

### 示范程序

每场Rails Girls 活动以一场“安装晚会”(Installation-fest或Installfest，由Installation【安装】和Festival【节庆】组成的新造词，由Linux User Group发明)拉开序幕。在这第一天晚上，女孩们将学习在自己的计算机上安装开发所必需的软件。教程在这里[railsgirls.com/install](http://railsgirls.com/install)。安装晚会上会有一些简短的教学，但是更加重要的是分享汽酒(sparkling wine)，为第二天作准备，以及让大家提前互相认识一下。时间应该根据参与者的需求和当地习俗灵活安排。我们有时选择周末，有时则是工作日。另外，如果有必要，也可以考虑连续两个晚上，比如从下午4点到晚上10点。

#### 教学的目标

* 理解动态和静态网页的区别。
* 网络的语言：让学员对于一个web程序的构成有一个初步的了解。学习编程ABC：字符串、方法、变量、数组、exclamations、chaining、哈希表、符号(blocks)、块(blocks)... 以及工具如终端(terminal)、浏览器、文本编辑器等。介绍大家认识互联网的基本功能模块：编程语言、框架(frameworks)、数据库以及它的基础设施。
* 让学员知道从哪里入手学习编程，无论是在线还是离线。

#### 周五晚上：安装晚会（这里所有时间仅供参考，具体时间当然可以自行调整）

19:00 - 21:00 安装软件，互相认识 
*提示* 可以设一个教练桌，用来为计算机有问题的学员答疑

不可避免的是，有些计算机也许无法完成安装：遇到这种情况，让学员结对学习，请不要在安装上花费过多的时间。

用气球和海报装点会场。让这个晚上  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/lindaliukas/playlist/1fgkUFCFDrSn621kf4iHhr">playlist</a> 生动起来！

或是即兴发挥，设计一些破冰环节：比如让女孩们在便利贴上写下她们参加活动的原因，或画出她们梦想中的web程序。

21 -> 教练们共进晚餐
在晚餐中可以和教练们温习一下第二天将要讲解的web程序


#### 周六：工作室(workshop)

09:00 - 10:00 报到、咖啡 
*提示* 预留足够的时间让大家熟络关系，解决安装中可能留下的问题。分发讲义，收集Bento练习所用的名词缩写。

10:00 - 10:10 致欢迎词
*提示* 提及赞助单位和个人的名字，展示我们将开发的web程序，简介什么是编程

10:30 - 11:00 用户体验(UX) workshop

11:00 - 11:30 编程入门
*提示* 请一位教练讲解这一环节，解释为什么我们要学习Ruby，尽管主要工具是Rails

主题应包括:
+ 动态与静态网页的区别，什么是web程序(web apps)？
+ 什么是编程语言？什么是Rails？
+ 我们将使用的工具：浏览器、终端、代码编辑器、程序目录构成

演示 <a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.org</a>, 并用它讲解Ruby，做3-4个练习。

11:30 - 13:00 工作室时间
（请控制速度，不宜过快！）：将 <a href="http://railsgirls.com/app">railsgirls.com/app</a>这个教程过一遍，解释每一步我们在做什么，以及重要的名词和概念。

讲解贵在简单，即使是牺牲准确性。无需解释所有高深的概念。只需在出现问题的时候予以回答，如果问题过于艰涩或“超纲”，应当果断跳过。我们不是在传授完美的编程本领，而是教授怎样解决实际问题。学员们首先需要学会“走”，然后才是“跑”。

应覆盖的概念(此处为准确性而不翻译):
+ Rails Generators
+ Scaffolds: Rails App Structure（ Rails程序的架构 ）
+ Gem Management （Gem的管理）
+ MVC, REST/Resources
+ Models and Active Record
+ Controllers and ActionController
+ Views and ERB

*提示:* 教练们也是凡人，他们很可能也是初次参加这个活动。教学可能令他们怯场或畏难，所以要在有困难的时候及时帮助教练和团队，哪怕只是鼓励和支持。

13:00 - 14:00 午饭

14:00 - 14:30 "弁当"(Bentobox)练习：
把技术名词放到上下文中对号入座，我们把这个概念称作“弁当”（见下文幻灯片链接）

两个小练习：
1) 用一个“弁当”板来讲解10个技术词汇
2) 讲解女孩们自己向教练提交的名词

+ [Bentobox slidedeck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls/p/rails-girls-bentobox-exercise)
+ [Instruction video](http://vimeo.com/39049632)

14:30 - 18:00 Workshop time. 

Time to continue working on the applications. Monitor the situation: when it seems like people have a hard time concentrating, have the coaches or other speakers give quick lightning talks. 

Example topics for lighting talks: 
+ Real (female) programmers telling what their career has been like.
+ Design: UX & UI. Making mockups together either with paper or computer. 
+ Fun ways of explaining technical concepts and recent frameworks: what is CoffeeScript explained in 80s pop songs? How would you describe GitHub? What coding and creative writing have in common?
+ Show us something real: don’t speak in abstractions, be specific and tell stories.

Once everyone has finished their app, there is time to extend the application by modifying the CSS, implementing commenting systems etc. Allow enough time for experimentation. 

19:00 After party
*Hint:*
Invite everyone, also the local developers, boys, those who weren't accepted, to join! 

[Fork this project on GitHub][github], add yourself, and send us a pull request.

#### Materials

* Programming 101 slides
* Bentobox exercise

### Promotion of Rails Girls

Every Rails Girls workshop will get a custom website at railsgirls.com/city where the information is collected and then stored. For past cities, see [railsgirls.com/events](railsgirls.com/events)

While the event is underway, remember to take pictures, collect tweets and ask questions of the participants. We love to write blog posts about the speaker and participant experiences. A list of the coaches is also required.

#### How to find local developers?

* Google. Almost every country has some sort of a Rails or Ruby community (sometimes called Ruby Brigade or Ruby Tuesday). Look for [Hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com) meetups, [GitHub](http://www.github.com) contributors or [Dribbble](http://dribbble) draftees. Find the local open source scene. Surf the technology conferences (here's [a list](http://rubythere.com/) of Ruby-themed ones, but others are cool too) and meetups at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com). Call software development houses, big and small. Don't forget IRC and podcasts!

* Check out hashtags like #rails #ruby and #opensource from [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/#!/search-home). To find people from, say, close to NYC, use the following search operators "near:NYC within:15mi". Some countries have specific hashtags like #Rubysur and #RubyArg they use, remember to ask!

* Startup community. Startup Digest is a good beginning point for events and communities.

* Often there are one or two key people who will be able to introduce you further. The technology world is surprisingly connected.

#### How to find participants?

* Use social media: Facebook, Twitter & local networks such as Weibo. Friends, girlfriends, co-workers!

* Local [Girls in Tech](https://twitter.com/#!/gitweet), [DevChix](http://www.devchix.com/), [Geek Girl](http://geekgirlmeetup.com/) chapters etc. Check out also [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). Twitter lists like @anitaborg's [Tech Women Programs](https://twitter.com/#!/anitaborg_org/tech-women-programs) and similar.

* Think outside the box: universities, book clubs, music stores, design agencies, [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). We want girls who are interested in technology, but they can still have very varied backgrounds.

#### How to get press?

One of the big aims of Rails Girls is to make it more mainstream for girls to build the web. That’s why we like to engage the local press and highlight the participants and their enthusiasm. We’d be happy to help prepare a press-release for the media. Check out [railsgirls.com/press](http://railsgirls.com/press) for more.

### Sponsorships

Rails Girls talks to a demographic that might be hard to reach other ways: women who have an interest in technology, who are possible users, employees or partners of the sponsoring company.

We are looking for sponsors who are active participants in the local technology scene, whether it’s a startup or a big corporation, a non-profit or a government organization.

Also non-traditional technology companies can be approached: kids stores, universities, women's magazines, beverage brands etc. They all should however have some affiliation or interest in technology. 

Rails Girls should always be kept non-profit: if there's money left, it should be used to support the future activities of the attendees.

### How much does it cost? 

The costs below are estimated for 30 participants, 10 coaches - but they may vary a lot. It's easiest to try to get a local sponsor to pay the bills directly or partner with someone who has a set account to handle money. These calculations are done in Finland, in €, where food & alcohol is very expensive, but spaces are often free. All in all you should be able to organise an event easily for a little over a thousand euros.  				

+ **Sparkling wine + cups** for the installation festival. 6 bottles, 6 euros a bottle. 36 euros. 

+ **Breakfast Coffee**, pastry. 40 times around 5 euros. 200 euros

+ **Lunch.** Catered lunch can be around 15 euros, but you can do with a lot less by cooking yourself.  Add some water and coffee (50 euros). 650 euros. 		

+ **Marketing materials.** Printing workbooks, ordering stickers, posters and other swag. Again, varies a lot, maybe you can use someones printer, but at least around 200 should be reserved.

+ **Coach dinner.** At a restaurant or homemade. A way to say thank you to the coaches for their volunteer work. Around 20 euros per head. 200 euros. 		

+ **Space.** Try to get this one sponsored/free, they can be really expensive. Often startups are co-operative and can offer their space for use (esp. on weekends).	0 - XXXX euros. 

+ **Afterparty.** It's nice if you can throw a good party with free beverages, but can also be done low-key in a local bar or on set/ in the park!	0 - XXXX euros. 	

+ **Travel expenses.**	If you don't have any RG-team members in your country, consider inviting us over. We don't need fancy hotels, promise! Same if you want to invite speakers to your event. 	0 - XXX		

+ *Total 1286 euros*.

__What do sponsors get?__

* Logo on event website
* Table space at event, opportunity to distribute handouts and/or swag
* A chance to speak to attendees for 5 minutes
* In most events there are official pictures taken that the sponsors can use afterwards

Don’t give out the participant info, but sponsors are free to hang out at the event and be sure to include a short message to the sponsor in a thank-you note. Sponsor swag may be included in the goodie bag to an extent, but it should be something tasteful, not trashy and related to girls.

## FAQ

#### Who can organise a Rails Girls workshop?

Anyone. What we look for is a group of people dedicated in making this a stellar first experience in the world of web making for girls. What we hope to see is some (not all) of the following:

* Contacts to the local developer scene. We are pretty technology agnostic, so it doesn’t have to be purely Ruby & Rails people. In practice every event needs 5 or more coaches that have basic knowledge of Rails and two days to contribute. In general the events have been around 25 - 40 people strong.
* Event organisation know-how. Nt heaps, but some practicalities under the belt.
* An inkling of an idea where to look for girls interested in technology. University, literature, arts, sports - we try to look for people who are interested in Internet, but do not have experience in coding.
* Willingness to guide the girls in the future if they have questions or want to organize their own events or find local developer gatherings.

Start by filling out [railsgirls.com/inyourcity](http://railsgirls.com/inyourcity) and someone from our team will be in contact


#### What kind of venue is needed?

We recommend choosing a venue with a built-in infrastructure for around 30-50 persons. For a programming event, this means:
* High-speed, tested Internet. There’s going to be over 30 computers online all the time. Add to that mobilephones, streaming music, funny videos and you get the picture!
* Space for 4-6 person groups to gather together: chairs and tables, sometimes big pillows will do! This doesn’t have to be in the same room.
* Possibility to set up extension chords and a projector.
* Location for food and beverage setup - lunch space for catering or a nearby lunch venue.
* External monitors for teams are encouraged but not mandatory, helps the coaches show what is happening in the code.

Ask where local developer meetings are usually hosted. Often co-working spaces are also willing to negotiate deals to gain some visibility among new people.

#### What is expected from the coaches?

Rails Girls events are organized around small groups, ideally maximum of 4-5 persons per one coach. The coaches don’t need to be hardcore experts on Rails - basic knowledge and willingness to explain trumps expertise. We are looking for people who like answering questions and can keep an upbeat and positive atmosphere through a period of 8 hours!

You can get to know the curriculum by checking out [railsgirls.com/app](http://railsgirls.com/app). There is also always a pre-event coach dinner where we’ll go through some pedagogical suggestions and check everyone knows what is happening. Avoid jargon, tie examples to what your doing, encourage asking questions. The installation instructions can be found at [railsgirls.com/install](http://railsgirls.com/install)

We hope the coaches are ok with having their name and twitter-id/github/some mean of contact on railsgirls.com so the girls always have a local face to answer their questions.

In addition, we encourage coaches to come up with additional exercises for the group. After completing the ideation app many girls will want to try tweaking the look & feel of the site, implementing commenting, Facebook sharing, pushing the app to Heroku etc. We have some plans to include these coach-planned mini-lectures in the site as well.

* Want to become a Rails Girls coach?
* Letter for the coaches

#### What materials do I get?

Each Rails Girls event gets a specific webpage.

In addition we’ll help you out with the goodie bags, poster templates, workbooks and other swag like stickers, reflectors and so forward. All of the materials can be found on this site. You can also ask the sponsors to include some sponsor materials if they wish. We are always looking for creative outlets for the Rails Girls brand, if you have ideas, let us know!

So far we've had

* Stickers
* Reflectors
* Tattoos

#### How do I choose attendees?

In the form we ask only two questions: do you have any previous background in coding and why would you be a good participant for Rails Girls

Rails Girls is intended for anyone and we want to keep it flexible enough for learners any age. However, make clear to the attendees what to expect: Rails Girls won’t make anyone into a coder, so people looking for i.e career change will be disappointed. On the other hand we like people with very diverse backgrounds and loads of enthusiasm.

After selecting participants we generally split them into three groups:

1. people with no previous programming experience
2. people with some front-end experience (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and
3. people with a little experience in programming or a background in computer sciences. You can use the different name-tags for each group if you want to (rubies, foxes, octocats, rails..)

#### What happens after the event?

Inviting real developers to coach is Rails Girls sessions not only gives the participants a chance for hands-on education, but also makes the barrier to enter the technology world lower. How to keep the girls coding?

* Encourage them to continue practicing by trying different exercises like Codecademy and such.
* Mention at least two forthcoming developer events where the local coaches will be. Try to get the girls to attend actual developer meetups
* Invite everyone to the Facebook Group where they can ask questions.
* Invite the girls together again within a month. You can host these meetups at the Rails Girls global meetup page http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls/ - we’ll be happy to promote events. However, it doesn't matter under which brand you want to continue meeting - the important thing'
